# CMPUT 301 : Lab 2 Participation Exercise

## Student Details

- **Full Name:** `<Jeheon Lee>`
- **CCID:** `<jeheon>`

## References and Resources

While working on this lab, I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a resource when I ran into debugging issues. I also asked questions about how button click listeners work in Android and how to define the behavior of buttons when they are clicked. I used these explanations to understand the concepts and then implemented the solutions myself.
